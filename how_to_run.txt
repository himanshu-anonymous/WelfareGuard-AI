🚨 SATARK - LOCAL ENVIRONMENT SETUP 🚨
=========================================

Team, to get Satark running on your local machines without crashing, follow these steps exactly in order. You will need 3 separate terminal windows open.

--- PREREQUISITES ---
1. Python 3.10+ installed.
2. Node.js installed (for Aarya's frontend).
3. REDIS: If you are on Windows, you must install WSL (Ubuntu) and run `sudo apt install redis-server`, then start it with `sudo service redis-server start`.
4. TESSERACT OCR: You must download and install the Windows executable for Tesseract. Install it to the default path: `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe`.

--- TERMINAL 1: THE BACKEND (Soham & Himanshu) ---
1. Open terminal in the root folder.
2. Create and activate your virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  (Windows) OR source venv/bin/activate (Mac/Linux)
3. Install the dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Boot the FastAPI server:
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   (Server will run on http://localhost:8000)

--- TERMINAL 2: THE ML WORKER QUEUE ---
1. Open a SECOND terminal in the root folder.
2. Activate the virtual environment again (.\venv\Scripts\activate).
3. Ensure your WSL Redis server is running!
4. Boot the Celery worker. *CRITICAL FOR WINDOWS:* You must use the --pool=solo flag!
   celery -A main.celery_app worker --pool=solo --loglevel=info

--- TERMINAL 3: THE FRONTEND (Aarya) ---
1. Open a THIRD terminal.
2. Navigate to the frontend folder (if applicable) or root:
   npm install
   npm run dev
   (React/Vite will usually run on http://localhost:5173 or 3000)

--- TROUBLESHOOTING ---
- If the OCR fails, check `vision_worker.py` and ensure the `pytesseract.tesseract_cmd` path exactly matches where you installed Tesseract on your PC.
- If you get a "password cannot be longer than 72 bytes" error on login, your bcrypt version is wrong. Run `pip install bcrypt==3.2.2`.

Let's build this.
